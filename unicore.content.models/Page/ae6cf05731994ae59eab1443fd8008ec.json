She will help you to give birth safely and she will do what is necessary if there is a problem.\r\n\r\n - \tMake sure you have her phone number so you can call her in an emergency. \r\n\r\n - \tHave ambulance and taxi numbers ready and make sure you have enough airtime on your phone. \r\n\r\n - \tMake sure your family knows how to contact the birth attendant when it is time. \r\n\r\n - \tMake sure you have a birth kit ready. Your birth attendant may bring a birth kit. It will contain a plastic sheet, gloves, clean string and tools for cutting your baby's cord. All these items are important for a clean, safe birth. \r\n\r\nIf you cannot get a birth kit, find a clean sheet to have your baby on and 2 cloths, one to dry your baby and one to wrap her in. Have 2 pieces of string, a clean, sharp knife or a clean pair of scissors ready. Your attendant must wash her hands and you must wash between your legs. Get plenty of clean, boiled water and soap ready.\r\n\r\n",
