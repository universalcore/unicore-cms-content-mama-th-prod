This will help. Explain to other people what effect their smoking will have on your baby growing inside you. \r\n\r\nStay away from smoke. Smoke can make you weak and sick. Open the windows, if your house gets too smoky from cooking.  \r\n\r\nAsk family and friends to smoke outside. \r\n\r\nYou could also try some of these ideas:\r\n\r\n - \tCook outside if you can, so less smoke goes in the house\r\n\r\n - \tUse gas, electricity or a kerosene cooker if possible\r\n\r\n - \tMake your stove about waist height - so you do not have to lean over the fire and breathe in smoke while you are cooking\r\n\r\n - \tUsing a lid will keep the heat inside the pot, and reduces cooking time, so you will breathe in less smoke\r\n\r\n - \tSoak food before cooking to reduce cooking time\r\n\r\n - \tMopping the floors with a damp cloth can reduce the amount of dust you breathe in\r\n\r\n",
