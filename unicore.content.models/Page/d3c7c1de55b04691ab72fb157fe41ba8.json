Water keeps you fresh and well, and can help wash away germs in your body. \r\n\r\nSometimes, water looks clean, but has invisible germs in it which can make you and your baby very sick. Avoid using dirty water by preparing clean, safe water in the morning for each day.\r\n\r\nIf there is no clean water where you live, you can make water clean and safe. Pour the water through a clean cotton cloth, and then boil it. This will get rid of the germs. Cool boiled water is safe to drink. Boil up a large bucket for the day. Cover it and keep it in a cool area, out of the way. This will stop flies and dirt getting in. \r\n\r\nIf you cannot boil and filter your water, ask your health worker about other methods of making your water safe to drink.\r\n\r\nBuying bottled water is usually clean and safe. Always check that the seal on the bottle you buy is not broken. A broken seal means the water has been opened before. The bottle could have been refilled with dirty water if the seal is broken, so do not drink it.\r\n\r\n",
