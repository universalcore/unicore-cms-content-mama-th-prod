They will help you stay well and your baby grow strong bones and teeth.\r\n\r\nCalcium is a mineral that helps bones and teeth to grow. You need plenty of calcium, because your bones are still growing too. It may also help reduce the risk of high blood pressure.\r\n\r\nCalcium forms your baby's bones and teeth. It also helps to control the rhythm of his heart. If you are not getting enough calcium your baby will not go without, but you will. That is because, where minerals are concerned, your body puts your baby first. \r\n\r\nYou can get calcium from:\r\n\r\n - \tsoy milk and coconut milk\r\n\r\n - \ttofu and green leafy vegetables\r\n\r\n - \tfish, especially oily fish like sardines.\r\n\r\nTo help you absorb calcium you also need to make sure you're getting enough vitamin D. Your body makes vitamin D from sunlight.\r\n\r\n",
