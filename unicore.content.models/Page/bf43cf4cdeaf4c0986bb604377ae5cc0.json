  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\n If you are HIV+, you may wonder if breastfeeding is a good thing. \r\n\r\nTell your health worker you are HIV+ and take her advice on the best way to feed your baby. This is because if you are HIV+ your breastmilk may contain the HIV virus which can be passed on to your baby. \r\n\r\nIf you are HIV+, your baby will need ARV medication after he is born, to protect him from HIV.  Ask your doctor for ARV medication for your baby.                                                                                                    \r\n\r\nYou may be able to get free infant formula milk from your health worker. Ask your health worker about this. If you are not breastfeeding, talk to your health worker about how to prepare milk for your baby. Ask them to teach you how to do this and ask any questions you may have.\r\n\r\nIf you are using infant formula, you will need to mix it with clean, safe water. Make sure you prepare clean, safe water by boiling it before you mix the formula. Make sure you clean the bottle or cup you use to feed your baby, using boiling water or using a method recommended by your doctor.\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to always feed your baby the same type of milk. This helps him to get all the goodness from the type of milk you give him. \r\n\r\nThe best way to protect your baby from HIV is tell your health workerr that you are HIV+. Your health worker can help you both stay healthy by giving you and your baby ARVs.\r\n\r\n",
