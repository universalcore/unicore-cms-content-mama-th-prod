This is because, as her belly fills up with milk, her bowels get stimulated.\r\n\r\nBreastfed babies usually have yellowish stools which smell sweet, and they tend to be soft. After they reach 1 month old, most babies have 1 or 2 bowel movements a day.\r\n\r\nYour baby\u2019s stools may change at 6 months when she starts solid food. But bowel movements will settle down once your baby gets used to her new food. \r\n\r\nSo, notice your baby's stools. If your baby passes smelly, watery and mucus-streaked stools more often, has a fever or seems to be losing weight, then your baby probably has diarrhoea. Take her to a health worker.\r\n\r\n",
