You need extra care in early labour to prevent the HIV virus being passed to your baby. \r\n\r\nWhen your baby is here, it is really good for him if you breastfeed and, at the same time, you both take ARVs. When you take your ARVS, it will make your milk safe for your baby.\r\n\r\nYour baby needs a daily dose of ARV syrup for 4 to 6 weeks after the birth, to protect him from HIV. Your baby will need a blood test at the clinic at around 6 weeks to check if the HIV virus has passed to him.\r\n\r\nMake sure you touch your baby with clean hands. Cover all cuts and wounds with a bandage until they heal. \r\n\r\nHIV is a long-term illness. With the right medicines, you can manage and control it. \r\n\r\nBreastmilk is all your baby needs for his first six months.  Do not give him any other milk because this makes it more likely that your baby will get HIV. \r\n\r\n",
