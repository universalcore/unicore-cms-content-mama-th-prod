  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nIt is safest, and recommended, to give birth in a health facility, where there is help if there are problems.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot have your baby at a health facility, here is how to have a safe birth.\r\n\r\n - \tPlan to have a skilled birth attendant, such as a registered midwife or nurse from the government clinic with you. She will help you to give birth safely and she will do what is necessary if there is a problem.\r\n\r\n - \tMake sure you have her phone number so you can call her in an emergency. \r\n\r\n - \tHave ambulance and taxi numbers ready and make sure you have enough credit on the phone. \r\n\r\n - \tMake sure your family knows how to contact the midwife when it is time. \r\n\r\n - \tMake sure you have a birth kit ready. Your midwife may bring a birth kit. It will contain a sheet, gloves, clean string and tools for cutting your baby's cord. All these items are important for a clean, safe birth. \r\n\r\n - \tIf you cannot get a birth kit, find a clean sheet to have your baby on and 2 cloths, one to dry your baby and one to wrap her in. Have 2 pieces of clean string, a clean, sharp knife or a clean pair of scissors ready. Your midwife must wash her hands and you must wash between your legs. Get plenty of clean, boiled water and soap ready.\r\n\r\n",
