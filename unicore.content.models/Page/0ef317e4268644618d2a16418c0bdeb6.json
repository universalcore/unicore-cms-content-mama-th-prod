  "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nIt is common to get headaches during pregnancy, particularly in the first 3 months.\r\n\r\nHeadaches may be caused by pregnancy hormones. Feeling tired or stressed can tense your muscles and give you a headache. Missing meals and feeling hungry might bring on a headache. Or having more sleep than usual, or too little sleep. \r\n\r\nHere are some things you can do: \r\n\r\n - \tMake sure you can take a break during the day and rest. Explain to your family you need more rest while your body is growing a baby. Sit or lie down somewhere quiet, and sleep if you need to.\r\n\r\n - \tDip a cloth in warm, clean water and squeeze out to make a warm pad. Put it around your eyes and nose. Or you could try a cool cloth on your forehead or at the base of your neck.\r\n\r\n - \tAsk someone to massage your neck and shoulders.\r\n\r\n**Danger signs?** Headache, blurred vision and pain under your ribs can be signs of high blood pressure. Go to see a health worker as soon as you can if you feel like this.\r\n\r\n",
