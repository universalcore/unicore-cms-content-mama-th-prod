Is your skin changing? Are you breathless? Welcome to pregnancy!\r\n\r\n**These are warning signs:** See a health worker if you have any of these feelings:\r\n\r\n - \tPain in your belly\r\n\r\n - \tA fever\r\n\r\n - \tBlurred vision and you are seeing spots in front of your eyes\r\n\r\n - \tFluid leaking from your vagina\r\n\r\n - \tPain when urinating\r\n\r\n - \tIf you are past 5 months in your pregnancy, and your baby has stopped kicking or is kicking much less\r\n\r\n - If you have heavy bleeding or bleeding with pain\r\n\r\n",
