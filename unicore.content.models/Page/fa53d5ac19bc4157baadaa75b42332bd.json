You could try to save your money to help pay for things you and your baby might need.\r\n\r\nSmoking when you are pregnant can make your baby weak and sickly. It is also bad for your baby when you are breastfeeding. \r\n\r\nYou could ask your family to help you to stop smoking. You might let them know that smoke in the house is also bad for the baby. Maybe you could ask them to stop with you. You could ask anyone who smokes in the house to smoke outside, now you are pregnant. \r\n\r\nIf you smoke, start cutting down or quit. It will be difficult, but it is definitely worth it for your baby. Start by cutting down small amounts every day. If you are finding it really hard to cut down, talk to your health worker.\r\n\r\n",
