Treatment will protect you and your baby. \r\n\r\nBe alert to the signs of TB in your own body, and in those around you, TB is an infection which can be very dangerous. It spreads through the air by coughs and sneezes. It can stay in the air for a long time.  \r\n\r\nIf you have a cough for more than 2 weeks or have lost weight unexpectedly, see a health worker. They will be able to check if you have TB and can give you the right medicines. \r\n\r\nIf you finish all the medicines, you can kill TB completely. Stopping taking the medicines before you finish can make the TB come back.\r\n\r\nYou can catch TB more easily when you are pregnant. Try to take extra care by eating well and staying away from crowded areas and people coughing and sneezing.\r\n\r\nIf anyone in your family or household has TB, they will stop being infectious after taking medication for 2 weeks. Ask them to cover their mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing, and to wash their hands regularly. \r\n\r\n",
